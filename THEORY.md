# Theory in chronological learning order

Started from this tutorial (+ chatgpt ofc):
[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-neural-network-from-scratch/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-neural-network-from-scratch/)

Python script here: [scripts/neural1.py](scripts/neural1.py)

Stopped at the forward propagation, cuz seemed too much of code to understand the whole idea.

Now gonna learn separated parts of this. Starting with Gradient descent and Stochastic gradient descent.

### Gradient descent
